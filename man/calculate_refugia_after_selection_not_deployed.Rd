\arguments{
\item{refugia.before.selection}{= The mean Polygenic Resistance Score of the mosquito population in the refugia  before selection has occurred that generation.}

\item{response.fitness}{= The response to selection from fitness costs only, such as would occur when the insecticide is either not deployed in the intervention site or the selection that occurs in the refugia.}
