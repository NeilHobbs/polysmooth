\arguments{
\item{vector.length}{= The length of the vector to be returned. A minimum value of 100,000 is recommmended.}

\item{trait.mean}{= The mean value of a polygenic trait in a population.}

\item{standard.deviation}{= The standard deviation of the trait mean in the population.}

\item{maximum.bioassay.survival.proportion}{= The maximum proportion of mosquitoes that can survive in the bioassay.}

\item{michaelis.menten.slope}{= The slope in the Michaelis-Menten equation.}

\item{half.population.bioassay.survival.resistance}{= The Polygenic Resistance Score which gives a 50\% survival probability in a WHO cylinder bioassay.}

\item{regression.coefficient}{= A linear model coefficient obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.}

\item{regression.intercept}{= The linear model intercept obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.}

\item{current.insecticide.efficacy}{= The current efficacy of the insecticide, defined as proportion of fully susceptible mosquitoes surviving contact with the insecticide-treated surface.}

\item{insecticide.exposure}{= The proportion of the mosquito population in the intervention site being exposed to an insecticide.}
