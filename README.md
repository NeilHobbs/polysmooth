Modelling insecticide resistance as a polygenetic trait: SMOOTH SELECTION

This version of modelling insecticide resistance as a polygenic trait has insecticide selection occurring through smooth selection. This is where survival to the insecticide survival of an individual is dependent on the Polygenic Resistance Score of the individual. E.g. if an individual mosquito has a polygenic resistance score that gives 10% bioassay survival, we would expect an individual with that polygenic resistance score to survive their encounter 10% of the time.
