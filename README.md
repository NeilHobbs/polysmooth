Modelling insecticide resistance as a polygenetic trait: SMOOTH SELECTION

This version of modelling insecticide resistance as a polygenic trait has insecticide selection occurring through smooth selection. This is where survival to the insecticide survival of an individual is dependent on the Polygenic Resistance Score of the individual. E.g. if an individual mosquito has a polygenic resistance score that gives 10% bioassay survival, we would expect an individual with that polygenic resistance score to survive their encounter 10% of the time. A separate model assuming selection by truncation is the polytruncate model.

Polysmooth allows for the exploration of multiple insecticide resistance management strategies applicable to vector-borne diseases; with the primary focus on _Anopheles_ mosquitoes. However the methodology and results are likely to be applicable across a wider range of vectors and pests; although some re-calibration of the model is likely to be required. 

Polysmooth allows for the direct comparison of a diverse array of insecticide resistance management strategies within the same modelling framework. Often theoretical models do not allow for multiple different IRM strategies to be directly compared. 

This model allows for the user input of a range of biological, chemical and operational parameters. The majority of parameter inputs can be descided by the user, as long as within a specified range.
