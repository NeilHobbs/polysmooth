Modelling insecticide resistance as a polygenetic trait.

This version of modelling insecticide as a polygenic trait has insecticide selection occurring through smooth selection. This is where survival to the insecticide is dependent on the Polygenic Resistance Score of the individual.

The model allows for the input of biological, chemical and operational parameters.
